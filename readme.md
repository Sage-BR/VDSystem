Note: The new Implementation is not up to this system in order to work but each topsite.

TODO: Old lineage 2 clients don't support URL open in browser for players by default so its up to you to open the generated URL's on those chronicles with exception to Lucera that does that by default. There are code hints on where you should do that notably VoteCMD.java, these functions are also provided by some client protections like smartguard, sguard, and strixguard.
